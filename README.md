# Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a full-time software developer and here you can find some of the things I'm playing around with on the side.

I didn't think I would end up working with code later on in my life. After graduating high school, I left the U.S
and lived in Colombia for a couple of years. I tried going to college for a semester but life not walking through the
streets of Bogota or hopping buses from town to town in central Colombia got boring fast so I joined The Marine Corps for 5 years. Got to spend a few years in Okinawa and mainly spent my time working and training military working dogs. After getting out I continued that line of work in private security
at the Baghdad Embassy. 

Believe it or not that got boring as well and was on the hunt for anything at all that would get me out of there. What I realized is that
I wasn't bored in college or at the embassy, I just wanted a challenge. Living in San Antonio, I came across Codeup (career acceletator program) and applied and got in.
